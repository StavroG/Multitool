# Multitool
### An Arduino based Multitool that performs as a range finder and a digital spirt level.

**Materials:**
- Arduino
- MPU6050 Accelorometer/GyroScope
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sound sensor
- 10K Ohm resitor
- 4 pin button
- Laser diode (optional)

**Description:**
This Multitool uses an ultrasonic sound sensor to find the distance of an object. Can optionally add a laser diode to help aim the device. This tool can also measure how level a surface is by using an accelorometer/gyroscope to measure the pitch and roll of a surface. You can also measure yaw as well if you would like.
